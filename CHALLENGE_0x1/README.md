TribeHacks 2024 - Challenge 0x1

## BRIEF
It has been a matter of hours since the 3, now known as the Shadow Coalition, were taken to a secret location only known by those in attendence of the meeting at the Oval Office. They each had been given their own space to work in the secret location. Off in a remote black site the Shadow Colition was now prepared to take on the work of the Black Cypher. 

After having been settled for a while, the 3 reconvined in the main room to find a letter on the table. Marked as "Assignment #1" it read:

"If you are reading this, we have recieved chatter from our clandestine satiliate channels, about new Black Cypher chatter. Sent to you shortly, will be a message we intercepted. However, it seems to be encrypted so we have no idea what it says. We need you to find out what the message says. The fate of national security rests on it. Good luck Shadow Coalition we are counting on you.

\- P"

## MISSION
You have been selected to be the reverse engineer for the Shadow Coalition. Your first mission, should you choose to accept is to decrypt the satilate message and report it back to Cyber Command with your findings.
