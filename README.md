First solarwinds, then the BlackCat group, and now no one knows what will come next. Chatter has begin to surface that a larger force is responisble for the recent attacks, and they are planning something way worse. The group known as "Black Cypher", is said to be a culmination of nation states, with one goal... crimple the US and their security infrastructure. <br>


As a result of surfacing of "Black Cypher" the president at the advice of the Intelligence Community, has passed executive order 1693. This executive order calls for the immediate assembly of the Shadow Coalition, a group of cyber security professionals brought together to protect nation's cyber infrastructure. To lead this convert group of cyber professional's the Intelligence community put forth 3 individuals comprise the group. On the morning of April 7th, at 7:30am the 3 individuals were brought to the Oval Office and briefed on the state of national security.<br>

The 3 members brought forth for the creation of the Shadow Coalition were Jackson Kubin, Carlo Mehegan, and Nic Janis. Upon entering the Oval Office, the president begin explain the situtation and why the 3 of them were here. He urged the importance of the Shadow Coalition and the importance of its secrecy. He then looked at Jackson Kubin and said, "Jackson, you have shown strong leadership skills; for that you are being hereby appointed the leader of the Shadow Coalition. You will have the full backing of the US and the intelligence community to aid you in your efforts. Your codename shall be The Commander".

He turned to Carlo Mehegan and said, "Carlo, you have shown strong intutition and python skills. Your quick thinking and ability to whip up quick scripts that can solve even the toughest challenges, has made you key for this role. Your codename shall be the The Dreamer."

Lastly, he turned to Nic Janis and said, "Nic, with your immensense knowledge of system's internals and your ability to write on and understand any system, you will be the team's sole systems engineer. Your codename shall be the Assembler."

To all 3, the president said, "You shall be transported to a secure location and begin work against Black Cyper at once. Time and security is of the essence. Recruit who you must, but tell no one. The fate of national security now lies in your hands."

With that the 3, now known as the Shadow Coalition, were taken to a secret location only known by those in attendence of the meeting at the Oval Office. Apon arrival each member was escorted to a room with all the equipment they would need on their desks. 

After getting settled, the 3 reconvined in the main room to find a letter on the table. Marked as "Assignment #1" it read:
