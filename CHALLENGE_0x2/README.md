"If you are watching this, that means you have successfully decrypted our message. However, you didn't think we would make it that easy did you? The Black Cypher isn't that careless. Either way it doesn't matter you are no match for the Black Cypher. Nonetheless, know that we have eyes every where. The Black shall not rest until our mission is done. However, if you wish to protect your little base of operations, I recomend you start by picking up that phone."

Just then the screen cuts to black, and a faint buzz begins to be heard in the background. Off in the far corner, a phone can be seen under some papers. Upon answer it...

"I told you we have eyes every where. This is only the beginning. Click..."

"Some figure out where it is coming from and shut this down! Plus when is the new guy getting here? We need him now." - The Commander
