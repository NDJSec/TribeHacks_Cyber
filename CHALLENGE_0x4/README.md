"INCOMING MESSAGE... INCOMING MESSAGE..."

"What is that noise and how do we shut it off!" - The Commander

"I don't know, but I think it is important. Look at the message coming across. It is spelling Black Cypher." - The Assembler

Just then, all of the computers in the room go blank and a series of waves begin to appear on the screen. Then words...

"You think we would stop at just the phone? You can stop us, if you have any hope of saving your country you will follow our every command. But for now it's best that we keep you waiting, we don't want you to work too fast." - Unknown
